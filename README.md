# Skin Disease Detection

## Overview
This project is a sophisticated web application developed using the Flask framework, designed to leverage a TensorFlow model for advanced image processing and classification. Users can upload images of affected skin areas through the web interface, and the system will analyze and diagnose potential skin diseases using a trained machine learning model. The application integrates seamlessly with a MySQL database to ensure efficient data storage and management.
